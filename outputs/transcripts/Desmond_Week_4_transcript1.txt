  "transcription": "HOMEWORK\n\nIn chapter 11 of The Grier, Lowry allows readers to experience the sensations that Jones was feeling as if the readers were the ones receiving the memory themselves. The author creates this feeling by using Third Person Limited, as she shifts between Jonas's external feelings and his internal thoughts. Furthermore, by making readers experience what Jonas experiences, it surprises readers because of the withdrawn information, which changes with the readers and works them in. Moreover, because of the limited Third Person Limited also makes the reader question how The Giver feels and the person and thinks, creating a mysterous feeling.\n\nIn this extract from The Grier, Lowry uses Third Person Limited to show Jonas's feelings and thoughts, restricting the readers to only see and sense what Jonas did. The author emphasizes this by saying \"there was dots of cold\" and snowflakes were \"light, feathery flecks of crystals.\" This creates atmosphere by making the readers experience the detective poetry the readers feel as one with Jonas.",
