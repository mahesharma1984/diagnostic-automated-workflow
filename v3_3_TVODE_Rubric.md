# TVODE Rubric v3.3

## Overview

This rubric evaluates student literary analysis writing using three sub-metrics:
- **SM1**: Component Presence (40% weight)
- **SM2**: Density Performance (30% weight)  
- **SM3**: Cohesion Performance (30% weight)

---

## SM1: Component Presence

**Question:** Does the student have all TVODE components with quality details?

**Components Required:**
- Topic (literary device/concept)
- Verb (analytical verb)
- Object (what's affected)
- Detail (textual evidence)
- Effect (analytical claim)

**Detail Quality Tiers:**
- **Precise (5.0)**: Direct quote + attribution + 4 contextual elements
- **Precise (4.5-4.75)**: Direct quote + attribution + 2-3 contextual elements
- **Specific (4.0-4.25)**: Direct quote with some context
- **Vague (3.0)**: General descriptions without quotes
- **Missing (2.0)**: No details present

**Scoring Logic:**
- 5 components + precise details (5.0) → SM1 = 5.0, Ceiling = 5.0
- 5 components + precise details (4.5+) → SM1 = 4.5, Ceiling = 4.5
- 5 components + specific details (4.0+) → SM1 = 4.0, Ceiling = 4.0
- 4+ components + specific details (4.0+) → SM1 = 3.5, Ceiling = 4.0
- 4+ components OR vague details (3.0+) → SM1 = 3.0, Ceiling = 3.0
- 3 components → SM1 = 2.5, Ceiling = 3.0
- 2 components → SM1 = 2.0, Ceiling = 2.5
- <2 components → SM1 = 1.5, Ceiling = 2.0

## SM2: Density Performance

**Question:** Given the detail quality available, how well did the student maximize analytical insights?

Is the student working hard to develop insights, even if the foundation is weak?

**NEW: Effect Depth Dimensions**

Analytical insights operate across three dimensions of depth:

| Dimension | What It Shows | Signal Phrases |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Reader Response** | How device affects reader experience | "makes the reader question/feel/believe", "creates suspense/mystery", "engages the reader" |
| **Meaning Creation** | What device reveals about text/characters | "reveals how...", "exposes the gap...", "demonstrates that...", "shows us how..." |
| **Thematic Impact** | How device connects to broader themes | "reinforces the theme of...", "challenges the idea that...", "reflects the novel's concern with..." |

**Depth Requirements by Score:**

* **5.0/5** = 3-4 distinct insights covering ALL THREE dimensions (reader response + meaning creation + thematic impact)
* **4.0/5** = 3-4 distinct analytical attempts (any combination of dimensions)
* **3.0-3.5/5** = 2-3 insights, may be limited to one dimension or show repetition
* **2.0-2.5/5** = 1-2 insights, mostly surface-level
* **1.0-1.5/5** = Minimal analysis, plot summary dominates

**Assessment Tip:** A student making 4 insights all at "reader response" level (makes reader feel X, makes reader question Y) scores 4.0. To reach 5.0, they need to also show meaning creation AND thematic impact.

**Scoring Logic (within ceiling set by SM1):**

**If SM1 = 3 (vague details, ceiling = 3.0):**
* **1.0-1.5/5** = Minimal analytical work; heavy plot summary; not attempting analysis
* **2.0-2.5/5** = 1-2 insights, mostly reader response level; significant repetition
* **3.0/5** = **Maximum for ceiling**: 2-3 distinct attempts; shows effort; limited by vague details

**If SM1 = 4 (specific details, ceiling = 4.0):**
* **2.0-2.5/5** = Has specific details but doesn't analyze them; plot summary
* **3.0-3.5/5** = 2-3 insights, mostly one dimension (e.g., all reader response)
* **4.0/5** = 3-4 distinct observations across at least two dimensions

**If SM1 = 5 (precise details, ceiling = 5.0):**
* **3.5-4.0/5** = 3-4 insights across two dimensions
* **4.5/5** = 3-4 insights across all three dimensions with minor gaps
* **5.0/5** = Full coverage: reader response + meaning creation + thematic impact, all well-developed

## SM3: Cohesion Performance

**Question:** Given the detail quality available, how well are ideas connected?

Is the student attempting to build bridges between ideas with the details available?

**NEW: Grammar Error Bands**

Grammar errors are counted and mapped to score impact:

| Error Count | Score Impact | Description |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **0-1 errors** | No penalty | Minor issues, meaning fully clear |
| **2-3 errors** | -0.5 from max | Noticeable but meaning preserved |
| **4-5 errors** | -1.0 from max | Errors begin disrupting flow |
| **6+ errors** | -1.5 or more | Significant clarity problems |

**What counts as a grammar error:**
- Subject-verb agreement ("description are limited" ✗)
- Tense inconsistency ("makes the reader had experienced" ✗)
- Awkward phrasing ("feel more deep into" ✗)
- Missing/wrong articles or prepositions
- Run-on sentences or fragments
- Incorrect word forms ("as an result" ✗)

**What does NOT count:**
- Transcription artifacts (n/a markers, unclear words from handwriting)
- Stylistic choices that don't break grammar rules
- Minor punctuation issues that don't affect meaning

**Scoring Logic (within ceiling set by SM1):**

**If SM1 = 3 (vague details, ceiling = 3.0):**
* **1.0-1.5/5** = No connectors; 4+ grammar errors; ideas feel random
* **2.0-2.5/5** = 1-2 connector types; 2-3 grammar errors; basic structure
* **3.0/5** = **Maximum for ceiling**: 2+ connector types; 0-2 grammar errors; clear organization

**If SM1 = 4 (specific details, ceiling = 4.0):**
* **2.5/5** = 1 connector type; 4+ grammar errors; weak transitions
* **3.0/5** = 2 connector types; 2-3 grammar errors; adequate flow
* **3.5/5** = 3+ connector types; 2-3 grammar errors; good organization
* **4.0/5** = 3+ connector types; 0-1 grammar errors; strong Theme-Rheme chains

**If SM1 = 5 (precise details, ceiling = 5.0):**
* **4.0/5** = Good connectors; 2-3 grammar errors
* **4.5/5** = Excellent connectors; 0-1 grammar errors
* **5.0/5** = Seamless flow; no grammar errors; elegant subordination

## Overall Score Calculation

**Formula:** (SM1 × 0.40) + (SM2 × 0.30) + (SM3 × 0.30) × 5 = Total Points

**Example:**
- SM1 = 4.0, SM2 = 3.5, SM3 = 3.0
- Overall = (4.0 × 0.40) + (3.5 × 0.30) + (3.0 × 0.30) = 3.55/5
- Total Points = 3.55 × 5 = 17.75/25
