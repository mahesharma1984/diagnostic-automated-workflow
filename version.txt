VERSION HISTORY

v3.0.0 (2025-12-04) - Transcription Accuracy Overhaul
-----------------------------------------------------
CHANGES:
- Add Google Vision handwriting hint (en-t-i0-handwrit)
- Use paragraph structure for correct reading order (not spatial)
- Implement tiered routing based on OCR confidence:
  * Tier 1 (≥85%): Direct assembly, no Claude editing
  * Tier 2 (75-85%): Claude joining with validation
  * Tier 3 (<75%): Flag all for manual review
- Add validation check to prevent hallucination (word count, new words)
- Preserve kernel-based name normalization

RESULTS:
- Desmond: Fragments → Coherent (major improvement)
- Coden: Garbage → Readable (major improvement)
- No hallucination detected (validation passed)

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Strikethrough text still leaks through (future fix)


v2.0.0 (2025-12-03) - Google Vision Integration
-----------------------------------------------
CHANGES:
- Replace Claude vision with Google Cloud Vision API for OCR
- Add kernel context injection for character/term normalization
- Add --kernel and --ocr-engine CLI arguments

RESULTS:
- Reduced hallucination (no more "loving family" → "long body")
- Name normalization working (Jong → Jonas, Samness → Sameness)

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
- Claude structuring step still edits/hallucinates
- Led to V3 overhaul


v1.0.0 (2025-11-27) - Initial Release
-------------------------------------
FEATURES:
- Claude-only transcription with vision
- Multi-page support
- Uncertainty flagging
- Sentence-level review

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Claude hallucination on difficult handwriting
- "loving family" → "long body" type errors
